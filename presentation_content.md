# The Problem

- Quantum computing threatens classical cryptography.
- Secure communication is essential in the quantum era.
- There is a significant educational gap in understanding quantum cryptography.
- Lack of accessible tools for hands-on learning.

# Our Solution: Quantum Key Whisper

An interactive web-based platform for learning, simulating, and visualizing quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols.

- **Accessible**: Learn quantum cryptography from your browser.
- **Interactive**: Simulate the BB84 protocol in real-time.
- **Visual**: See quantum phenomena like eavesdropping happen.
- **Practical**: Bridge the gap between theory and practice.

# Key Innovations

- **Interactive BB84 Simulator**: The first comprehensive, web-based BB84 simulator with real-time visualization and a step-by-step animation of the QKD process.
- **Hybrid Quantum-Classical Integration**: Seamlessly combines classical web technologies (React, Flask) with a powerful quantum computing framework (Qiskit).
- **Multi-Layered Security Visualization**: Visually represents complex quantum security principles like QBER, entanglement, and the effects of eavesdropping.
- **Educational Gamification**: "Eve Mode" allows users to take on the role of an eavesdropper and attempt to intercept the quantum key, providing a unique, hands-on learning experience.
